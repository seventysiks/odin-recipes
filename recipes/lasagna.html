    <p>To make lasagna, gather all of your ingredients first! Then take your sausage,<br>
    ground beef, onion, and garlic, and cook in a Dutch oven over medium heat until<br>
    well browned.Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. <br>
    Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning,<br>
     fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.<br>
     Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water<br>
     for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine <br>
     ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Preheat the <br>
     oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom <br>
     of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. <br>
     Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
     Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.<br>
    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. <br>
    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking <br>
    spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. Bake in the <br>
    preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. <br>
    Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
